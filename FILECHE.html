        <h1 style="color: #fff;">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Biodiversity Database - Near LPU. Explore the fascinating world of flora and fauna in our region. The term biodiversity is made up of two words- bio and diversity. In the Convention of biological diversity (1992) in Rio Earth Summit, biodiversity has been defined as the variability among the living organisms from all sources including inter alia, terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are a part. The term biodiversity was first coined by Walter G. Rosen in 1986. It occurs at 3 different levels, but LPU recognizes two, namely:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Genetic diversity</li>
            <li>Species diversity</li>
        </ol>

            <h2 style="color: #FF0000;">GENETIC DIVERSITY</h2>
            <p>Genetic diversity is defined as genetic variability present within species. LPU Genetic diversity is the product of recombination of genetic material in the process of inheritance. It changes with time and space. Sexual reproduction is important in maintaining genetic diversity as it gives unique offspring by combining genes of parents. In LPU having four different breeds of dogs namely, Indian pariah dog, Kanni dog, Kombai dog, Aspin dog. Different varieties of flowers namely, Roses, Hibiscus, paper flower, wax mallow hibiscus, etc.

            <h2 style="color: #FF0000;">FIELD WORK</h2>
            <p>1. The Biodiversity is Quite diverse in LPU
                <br>
                2. Many Plants shed their leaves and some flowers such 
                as Roses start to Bloom during the fall season.
                <br>
                3. There are two head managers in LPU named RAM and 
                Ashwani who manage the Biodiversity in LPU.
                <br>
                4. There might not be as many animals as plants but 
                mainly dogs reside in the campus

            <h2 class="red-heading">WHAT AND HOW WE LEARNT</h2>
            <p>1. Some of the plants may look the same; they are of different species.<br> 2. The plants need to be shaped up so that they don’t overgrow.<br> 3. Some of the pigeons are actually fed by the university campus.<br> 4. There is a nursery where some of the beautiful flowers and plants are cared for.</p>

            <p>LPU is bestowed with a rich variety of plant species including 
                Pteridophytes, Gymnosperms, and Angiosperms.
                There are over 1000 types of plants in LPU, and new ones are 
                planted every year.<br>
                LPU is famous for its wide variety of roses, and color
                from white, off-white, pink, purple, magenta, red.<br> And in 
                addition to that, it has different shapes and sizes like tiny cute 
                little which occur in clusters. <br>
                I have found different varieties of palm trees in the LPU campus.<br> As 
                far as the tree species are concerned, we have found Devil’s tree, 
                Mango tree, banyan tree, Peepal tree, and other ornamental 
                plant species as well, creating a breathtaking environmental 
                and an educational environment for the students.</p>

            <h2 class="red-heading">CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>We have learned so many new things from this project <br>
                Most biodiversity resources are consumed by humans, so it is their primary 
                responsibility to preserve and protect biodiversity to protect the earth. The 
                richness of the species, the environment and the sustainable growth of life on 
                earth is important. It is the need of time to enforce strong legislative obligation 
                to prevent the illegal hunting of rear species.<br>
                The biodiversity of the LPU Campus enables activities like nature 
                photography, bird watching.</p>
